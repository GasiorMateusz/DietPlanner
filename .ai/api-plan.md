\# REST API Plan



This plan details the REST API for the Diet Planner application, based on the provided PRD, Database Plan, and Tech Stack.



\## 1. Resources



\-   \*\*`meal\_plans`\*\*: Represents the meal plans created by dietitians. Corresponds to the `public.meal\_plans` table.

\-   \*\*`ai\_sessions`\*\*: Represents the conversational AI chat sessions used to generate meal plans. Corresponds to the `public.ai\_chat\_sessions` table (for telemetry and state).

\-   \*\*`users`\*\*: Represents the dietitian's account. Corresponds to the `auth.users` table (managed by Supabase).

&nbsp;   ```json

&nbsp;   {

&nbsp;   ```json

&nbsp;   {

&nbsp;     "message": {

&nbsp;   -   `404 Not Found`: No chat session found with this ID for the user.

&nbsp;   -   `502 Bad Gateway`: Error communicating with OpenRouter.ai.



\### User Management (`/api/users`)



---



\#### `DELETE /api/users/me`



\-   \*\*Description\*\*: Permanently deletes the authenticated user's account and all associated data (meal plans, chat sessions) via the `ON DELETE CASCADE` rule in the database.

\-   \*\*Request Payload\*\*: None.

\-   \*\*Response Payload\*\* (204 No Content): Empty.

\-   \*\*Success Codes\*\*:

&nbsp;   -   `204 No Content`: The user account and all data were successfully deleted.

\-   \*\*Error Codes\*\*:

&nbsp;   -   `401 Unauthorized`: User is not authenticated.

&nbsp;   -   `500 Internal Server Error`: Failed to delete the user from `auth.users`.



\## 3. Authentication and Authorization



\-   \*\*Authentication\*\*: Handled via Supabase's built-in authentication. All API requests (except Supabase's built-in auth endpoints for login/register) must include a valid `Authorization: Bearer <SUPABASE\_JWT>` header. The backend will use this JWT to identify the user via `auth.uid()`.

\-   \*\*Authorization\*\*: Implemented at the database level using PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS), as defined in `db-plan.md`.

&nbsp;   -   \*\*`meal\_plans`\*\*: Users can only perform CRUD operations on their \*own\* records (`auth.uid() = user\_id`).

&nbsp;   -   \*\*`ai\_chat\_sessions`\*\*: Users can only `INSERT` new sessions. They cannot `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` any sessions, including their own, ensuring telemetry data is private and immutable.



\## 4. Validation and Business Logic



\-   \*\*Validation\*\*:

&nbsp;   -   Input validation will be performed by the API for all `POST`/`PUT` requests before hitting the database.

&nbsp;   -   This includes checking for `NOT NULL` fields (e.g., `meal\_plans.name`), correct data types (e.g., `patient\_age` is an integer), and enum constraints (e.g., `activity\_level` is one of the allowed values).

\-   \*\*Business Logic\*\*:

&nbsp;   -   \*\*Registration/Login/Reset\*\*: Handled by the Supabase client SDK (BaaS approach), not by this custom API.

&nbsp;   -   \*\*AI Interaction\*\*: The `POST /api/ai/sessions` and `POST /api/ai/sessions/{id}/message` endpoints orchestrate the business logic of communicating with OpenRouter.ai and logging telemetry to the `ai\_chat\_sessions` table.

&nbsp;   -   \*\*Plan Creation Workflow\*\*: The frontend bridges the gap between chat and editor. It takes the final response from `POST .../message`, lets the user edit, and then calls `POST /api/meal-plans` to save the final plan, linking it via the `source\_chat\_session\_id`.

&nbsp;   -   \*\*Dashboard Sorting\*\*: The `GET /api/meal-plans` endpoint defaults to sorting by `updated\_at desc` to fulfill `US-011` ("Newly saved meal plan is visible at the top..."). The `on\_meal\_plan\_update` trigger ensures `updated\_at` is always current.

&nbsp;   -   \*\*Dashboard Search\*\*: The `search` parameter on `GET /api/meal-plans` uses the `idx\_meal\_plans\_name\_trgm` index for fast, live filtering as required by `US-006`.

&nbsp;   -   \*\*Export\*\*: The `GET /api/meal-plans/{id}/export` endpoint reads the saved plan \*and\* its associated startup data (e.g., `patient\_age`, `target\_kcal`) to generate the complete .doc file as specified in `PRD 3.4`.
